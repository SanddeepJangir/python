# 1. take input two variables a and n, you need to print a, n times in a single line without space between them. 
a = input("enter a: ")
n = int(input("enter n: "))

# 2. take input three variables a, b, and c. You need to print a a times and b b times in a single line separated by c.
a = input()
b = input()
c = input()
print(a*int(a) + c + b*int(b))

# 3. String Input and Print: Take a text input as a string and print it as it is.
x = input()
print(x)

# 4. Integer Input and Add: Take an integer input n, add 10 to it, and print the result.
n = int(input())
print(n+10)

# 5. Float Input and Multiply: Take a floating-point number as input, multiply it by 10, and print the result.
f = float(input())
print(f*10)
